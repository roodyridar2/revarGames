# revarGames

Welcome to **revarGames** — a small, evolving collection of fun games built with React and TailwindCSS. This is a personal project that started from curiosity and is slowly growing into something more interactive and meaningful.

## Why this exists

Sometimes, you just want to build things that bring joy. **revarGames** is exactly that — a space to create and experiment with simple games, neat animations, and playful interactions. No pressure, no over-engineering — just code and creativity.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite for speed)
- **TailwindCSS** (for fast and clean styling)
- **i18n** support (basic, but growing)

## Features

- Basic multi-page structure
- Component-based layout for reusability
- Organized with custom hooks and assets
- Translation support setup (`118n.js`)

## Getting Started
